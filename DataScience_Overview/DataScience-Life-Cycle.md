# DataScience Project Life Cycle

DataScience is the one of the most popular methods to acquire meaning from the data. Hundreds of tools and algorithms have been using for many years. Today scientists created a method which is a process of problem solution steps, **DataScience** . Nowadays, DataScience is the most popular method. Below titles are the steps of DataScience, generally applying steps are such as Identify the Problem, Find available data source, Data munging, Applying algorithms, visualize the process, and finally report your result and maintenance if require. 

## Identify the Problem

Finding mysterious problems to analyze your system and acquire suggesting or predicting results from your stored data. [Stories](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Identifying-Problems.md) are being told!

## Find available data source

Data is the blood of your system.  [Here](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience#data-sets) is the blood donation box.

## Data Munging - Statistical analyse

Make your data readable and prepare in order to use in your system properly. So this step is most important part of your process. This [page](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/DataMunging.md) can be a good list for you!  

## Apply Algorithm to fix problem

Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithms can be applied to your problems. Engineers work to find best [algorithms](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Algorithms.md).

## Visualize the process

Visualization tools've been creating and sharing in the Internet for a long time. In fact, **Visualization** is  a kind of Art and lots of visualization artists create and develope visualization tools day by day. Look at this [page](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Visualization.md)! You can find magnificent data visualization tools in order to make your project as a masterpiece.

## Report your result and Maintenance 

 Project has not finished yet. This step makes your system **dynamic** and helps your results alive. Do you know how can you [report](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Report-your-result.md) you results ?
